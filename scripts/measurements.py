"""What a benchmark row's `measurement` holds, and the rules lint.py keeps on it.

A kind: benchmark row may carry `measurement` (schema/entry.schema.json): what
its own author measured, indexed field by field from the author's report — the
task, named datasets, comparators, kinds of metric, n, the model string, when,
whether per-item data is published, whether the protocol was fixed first, and
the author's own `direction`. Nothing in it was measured or reproduced here.
`read_on` dates a person's reading of the report against the fields; without
it a script or a model filled them in (docs/review-queue.md lists those rows).

How a measurement is read — which rows have one, how a direction is shown — is
the MCP package's query.py, loaded by its path as platform_values.py loads it,
so lint, the generated pages and the server read the same thing.
site/catalog-core.mjs applies the same rules on the site.

What lint holds (lint.check_measurement, lint.check_measurement_models):
* a measurement only on a kind: benchmark row;
* `as_of`, or the row's `published`, dates it: model versions move, and a
  measurement is of the model served that day;
* `as_of` and `read_on` are real dates, not in the future, and nobody read the
  report before the measurement was taken;
* `model_string` is a string compat.json lists on some surface (a string it
  does not list is left out of the row rather than recorded).

A negative result — a row whose own author measured Jev for its use and
concluded against it — is recorded in exactly one place. A benchmark says so
in `measurement.direction` (unfavourable); a row of any other kind carries the
`negative-result` flag, and lint (negative_flag_problems) holds it there: never
on a benchmark, where the flag and the direction could disagree, and always
with `notes` that say where the conclusion comes from: a link, a pull request
or issue number, or the measurement itself. Every surface derives "negative"
from either through query.is_negative_result().

Stdlib only, like the rest of scripts/.
