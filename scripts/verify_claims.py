"""Re-check that the primitive claims in catalog.json are still true upstream.

A row carrying `question_types` asserts which Jev primitives a project's code
actually calls. That assertion was true when a person read the call site, and
nothing stopped it going stale afterwards — an upstream refactor could remove
the integration entirely and this catalog would keep claiming it.

This script closes that gap. For every row with `evidence`, it fetches that file
from the repository's default branch and asserts every string in
`evidence.matched` still appears.

The file is read first at `HEAD` on raw.githubusercontent.com, which resolves
to the default branch without the API call per repository that asking for the
branch name costs. That resolution is observed behaviour, not documented, so
only a pass is taken from it: a file missing or changed at HEAD is read again at
the default branch the API names, and that read is what gets reported. A GitHub
rate limit leaves a claim unchecked (`skipped`), never failed.

Deliberately not pinned to a commit. Pinning would verify a historical snapshot
forever and never notice a removal, which defeats the purpose. The cost is that
an upstream rename reports `path-gone`; that is a false positive a person
resolves, not a reason to check the wrong thing.

Exit code is 0 when every claim holds and 1 when any fails, so the scheduled
workflow can open an issue.

A claim that lost only a pinned model version (`jev-1.2`, say) from a file that
now names another is reported as `version-moved` rather than `claim-gone`, and
the report counts those rows per version ("N rows now pin X"): when the vendor
ships a model, projects move their pin one by one, and each move is not a
removed integration. It still fails, since its strings are gone.
`--propose-version-rewrite` prints the rewritten `evidence.matched` for each
such row and writes nothing; a person applies it and leaves `read_on` alone.

A file whose claim holds is also searched for the primitives' request and
answer shapes — `"type": "choice"`, `Noul(`, `.noul` and the like
(PRIMITIVE_SHAPES), and a call to the TypeScript SDK's `choice()`, `score()`
or `noul()` imported from `@typesafe-ai/sdk` (ts_sdk_helpers) — never the bare
words. What it finds is a machine text
signal about that one file: it does not say the code calls the primitive, and
it is not `question_types`, which records what a person read the code calling.
`--write-signals` records it in each row's `primitives_seen`, the only field
this script ever writes; the weekly metadata run calls it and commits the
result with the other mechanical facts. Nothing reads `primitives_seen` in place
of `question_types`.

An `alternative` row's `wire` record cites the files its interface was read in
(wire.source: path and matched strings, as evidence does; scripts/wire.py).
Each of those files is re-read the same way and reported on its own line,
marked `wire.source`. A file there that lost only a model version is reported
`claim-gone`, not `version-moved`: the fields were read in it, so a person
re-reads it rather than rewriting strings.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/verify_claims.py                  # check every row with evidence, and every wire.source file
  python3 scripts/verify_claims.py --only slug      # check one row
  python3 scripts/verify_claims.py --discover       # propose evidence for rows lacking it
  python3 scripts/verify_claims.py --json           # machine-readable report
  python3 scripts/verify_claims.py --write-signals  # record primitives_seen in catalog.json
  python3 scripts/verify_claims.py --propose-version-rewrite [--json]
      # dry run: evidence.matched rewritten for each version-moved row
