"""Find catalog candidates by aggregating sibling lists, then verifying them.

There are dozens of Jev directories. Each is a different person's sweep of the
same ecosystem, so the union of them is a far better discovery surface than any
one — including this one. A repository cited by twenty lists is worth looking
at.

But citation frequency is not verification. These lists copy from each other,
so a repository miscatalogued once propagates everywhere: the most-starred
"Jev visual inference tool" in this ecosystem turned out to contain zero
references to the API, and it is listed as a Jev project almost universally.
Crowd agreement is a discovery signal and nothing more.

So this does both halves. It harvests every sibling list, ranks by how many
cite each repository, then reads the candidate's actual code looking for a call
site. What it emits is a shortlist for a person, never a catalog row — the whole
point of this catalog is that someone read the source.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/discover_candidates.py                 # top 40 candidates
  python3 scripts/discover_candidates.py --top 100
  python3 scripts/discover_candidates.py --json > out.json
  python3 scripts/discover_candidates.py --only owner/name   # re-read one candidate
  python3 scripts/discover_candidates.py --only owner/name --drafts drafts
      # ...and write drafts/<slug>.json, a draft row to complete (discover_drafts.py)
