"""The reader-facing sentences the READMEs and pattern pages print.

EN and ZH are one pack per language with the same keys; render() and
render_page() take a pack, which is what keeps the two READMEs structurally
identical instead of slowly diverging. The two tables below are bilingual rows
rather than packs because each row pairs a path with its description.

A few short labels (the reading-map summary, back links, the maintenance-check
captions, the caveat label in rows.py) are still chosen inline by language, and
coverage_note() in sections.py writes its own EN and zh sentences.
