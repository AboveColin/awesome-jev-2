"""Sweep every catalog URL and report which ones stopped resolving.

Read-only by default: it prints a report and exits non-zero when something is
dead, so a scheduled run opens a visible red build rather than silently
rewriting the catalog. Pass --write to stamp `checked` and `link_status` on the
rows that answered.

A refusal (401/403/429) is not a dead link, but a sweep where many are refused
has checked little. Refusals are counted for GitHub and for other hosts apart —
one is our token's budget, the other mostly Cloudflare-style bot walls — and
when more than REFUSAL_ALARM of either group refused, the sweep exits 3 and says
it was rate limited or blocked rather than looking like a quiet week. Every
count, and the GitHub budget spent, goes to the job summary.

Exit codes: 0 fine, 1 dead links, 3 too many refusals to trust a group.

A dead link is never deleted by this script. Moving a row to retired.json is a
judgement call — the row needs a `notes` line saying why — so a person does it.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/check_links.py               # report only
  python3 scripts/check_links.py --write       # also update checked/link_status
  python3 scripts/check_links.py --only youtube.com
