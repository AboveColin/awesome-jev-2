"""Run every generator, so a tree's generated files match its sources.

The sources are catalog.json, retired.json, compat.json, patterns.json,
taxonomy.json and collections.json, and the example code under examples/.
Everything listed in OUTPUTS below is derived from them, whole or in marked
blocks, and is never edited by hand.

Since 2026-09-27 a pull request does not have to carry that output. lint.yml
runs this on every event; on main its `regenerate` job commits the result as
github-actions[bot]. Run it yourself to see what your change will look like,
or to include the regenerated files in a pull request. That is optional, but
if you do include one, check_generated.py requires it to be exactly what this
writes.

Stdlib only, like the rest of scripts/.

Run: python3 scripts/regenerate.py
     python3 scripts/regenerate.py --list    # the output paths present, one per line
