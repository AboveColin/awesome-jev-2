"""What an alternative row's `wire` records, and the rules lint.py keeps on it.

A `kind: alternative` row is a project that is not Jev: a reimplementation of
its interface, a server that answers Jev-shaped requests with another model,
or a project that sends Jev the same requests to compare. The catalogue says
little else about them, and a reader cannot tell "same route, yes/no spelled
`boolean`" from "open weights behind the same route" from "a proxy in front of
another provider's model". `wire` records, field by field, what the project's
own files show about the interface it offers (schema/entry.schema.json):

* `endpoint`: the method and path its server answers a decision request on;
* `yesno_spelling`: the `type` its requests give Jev's yes/no question;
* `answer_field`: the key a yes/no answer's probability is read from;
* `confidence_field`: the key a choice or score answer's confidence is read from;
* `envelope`: `top-level` when state and questions sit at the top of the
  request body, as in Jev's own API; `wrapped` when they sit inside another field;
* `weights`: where its answers come from in the default configuration:
  `open`, a model whose weights you can run yourself (published, or produced by
  the project's own training code); `closed`, a model only the project runs;
  `proxy`, another provider's hosted model, which the server calls and reshapes;
* `base_model`: that answering model, as the cited file names it;
* `calls_real_jev_as_baseline`: a cited file sends Jev the same requests to
  compare with. Only `true` is recorded: no string can show a call is absent;
* `comparison_url`: where the project publishes a comparison with Jev;
* `source`: the files those were read in, each `{path, matched, read_on}` as
  `evidence` is. Every matched string must still be in its file, and
  scripts/verify_claims.py re-reads them every week. `read_on` dates a person's
  reading; without it a script or a model read the files and no person has since.

Nothing in it is inferred: a field the cited files do not show is left out, and
every surface prints a dash for it. A compatible interface implies nothing
about calibration, so every surface that shows `wire` shows the not-jev caveat
and CALIBRATION_NOTE (the second sentence of taxonomy.json's not-jev blurb) on
every row.

What lint holds (lint.check_wire):
* `wire` only on a kind: alternative row that carries the not-jev flag and a
  GitHub repository to read the cited files in;
* at least one field besides `source`, and no file cited twice;
* each value copied out of a file (the endpoint's path, yesno_spelling,
  answer_field, confidence_field, base_model) is inside one of the matched
  strings, so the string backing it is what the weekly run re-reads;
* calls_real_jev_as_baseline needs a matched string naming Jev's own host or a
  gateway's id for Jev (REAL_JEV_SIGNALS): a floor, not proof, like the words
  measurements.NEGATIVE_NOTE_SOURCE asks for;
* each `read_on` is a real date, not in the future.

docs/compatibility.md ("Compatible interfaces that are not Jev") and the site's
Compatibility view show these rows; docs/review-queue.md lists those no person
has read. site/catalog-core.mjs selects the same rows (scripts/tests/wire_cases.json).

Stdlib only, like the rest of scripts/.
