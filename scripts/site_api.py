"""The per-pattern JSON files the site serves to agents: site/api/v1/.

catalog.json runs to megabytes (docs/method.md dates its size), and no agent
reads it whole. Without the MCP server an agent's natural way in is one file
per decision pattern, so the Pages deploy writes

  api/v1/index.json             every pattern: key, name, description, how many
                                rows file under it, its file's URL and size,
                                plus links to the other published files
  api/v1/patterns/<key>.json    every row filed under that pattern

beside the site. A row is shaped exactly as the MCP server's search returns it
(`compact()` in src/awesome_jev_mcp/query.py) and in the same order
(`sort_key()`), so an agent gets one shape from either route. query.py is
standard library only and is loaded by its path: importing its package would
also run data.py, which the site does not need. pages.yml lists the file among
the scripts whose change redeploys the site (tests/test_site_api.py).

Nothing is filtered out. A pattern file holds as many rows as stats.json's
`by_pattern` counts, caveated rows included with their `caveats`; the index and
every file name the caveats that mean a row is not an example of calling Jev,
which the MCP server leaves out by default. The only date is the catalogue's
own (`last_sweep`), never the time of the build, so two deploys of the same
data serve the same bytes.

assemble_site.py writes the files (site/api/ is gitignored, like every other
copy under site/), and check_site_data.py holds them to a rebuild and to
stats.json before Pages publishes anything. Within v1 fields may be added; one
removed or renamed would be v2, at a new path.

llms_text() is here too: the llms.txt Pages serves, with its inline values
refilled as build_docs.py would. The committed file can trail a merge by the
regenerate job's commit, and a push by that bot starts no Pages run.
