"""Shared GitHub plumbing for the scripts that read upstream repositories.

Extracted because verify_claims.py and refresh_metadata.py both need the same
four things — a token, an API call, a raw file, and the owner/name out of a row
— and two copies of that would drift. Dependency-free like the rest of the repo:
urllib only, so CI stays `setup-python` with no install step.

Rate limits and blocked repositories are told apart (since 2026-09-27). GitHub
answers an exhausted budget with 403 or 429 and says so — `x-ratelimit-remaining:
0`, a `retry-after` header, or "rate limit" in the message — and answers a
repository it will not serve (a DMCA or terms-of-service block) with 403 or 451
and none of that. The first is about this run; the second is about one row.
Both used to be the same SystemExit, so one blocked repository ended a weekly
refresh before it had written anything, while a 429 passed for a missing row.

  * blocked      -> api_get returns {"blocked": True, "status", "message"}
  * rate limited -> wait what GitHub asks (at most RATE_WAIT_CAP seconds), retry
                    once, then raise RateLimited and send nothing more on that
                    budget for the rest of the run
  * nearly spent -> below the reserve, RateLimited without sending, until the
                    budget resets

RateLimited is a SystemExit(2), so a caller that does not handle it stops the
way every caller always did. The weekly jobs catch it per row, count the row as
skipped and keep what they already read. Every response's x-ratelimit-* headers
are recorded; usage_lines() says what a run spent and what is left.
