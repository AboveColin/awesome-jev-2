"""Run every check CI runs, in CI's order, with one command (I08).

The same checks used to be listed four times: lint.yml's steps, the commands in
CONTRIBUTING.md, the pull-request template's checklist and metadata.yml's
pre-push chain. The lists had drifted apart. Running CONTRIBUTING's commands
could pass while CI failed, because the unit tests, the node tests, the site
data and the curated collections were checked only in lint.yml, and the weekly
metadata refresh pushed to main after four of the checks. STEPS below is now
the one list: lint.yml's catalog job runs `check.py --ci`, its regenerate job
and metadata.yml run `check.py --ci --quick` before they push, and
CONTRIBUTING and the pull-request template name `check.py --fix`.
scripts/tests/test_check.py fails when lint.yml runs a script this list does
not cover.

Each step is one command, run from the repository root, in order. It records
its kind (fix: rewrites a source into canonical form, only with --fix;
generate: rewrites derived files, as CI does before validating them; verify;
report), the lint.yml job that runs it, and anything it needs besides Python:
node, chrome or the network. Every step runs even after an earlier one failed,
so one run shows every problem; only a step whose prerequisite failed is
skipped.

A step whose tool is missing (no node, no Chrome) is reported as skipped, and
the run can still pass. Under --ci it fails instead: CI must never pass by not
checking. A step that needs the network reports an unreachable service itself
(check_release.py says `skipped`).

Generated files are judged by check_generated.py, and the verdict depends on
the mode:
  default     strict: every generated file committed and current, as a
              dispatched lint run checks.
  --fix       as CI judges a pull request, against --base (default
              origin/main): generated files may be left out, but any the
              branch changed must be exactly what the generators write.
  --base REV  that pull-request verdict, without --fix.
  --ci        by $GITHUB_EVENT_NAME, as lint.yml always has: pull_request
              compares the merge commit's two parents, push hands drift to
              the regenerate job, anything else is strict.

The same base, where a mode has one, goes to lint.py as --base: it then also
warns about a row the change adds whose machine-translated Chinese drops a
number from the English. A pull request in CI compares with HEAD^1, --fix and
--base with that base; every other run has no base and gives no such warning,
so the rows already filed are never warned about run after run
(docs/zh-queue.md lists those).

Stdlib only, like the rest of scripts/.

Run: python3 scripts/check.py           # every check, strict about generated files
     python3 scripts/check.py --fix     # sort the catalogue first; judge as a pull request
     python3 scripts/check.py --quick   # skip the preview images (Chrome), PyPI and the review card (network)
     python3 scripts/check.py --list    # every step in order, and whether this mode runs it
     python3 scripts/check.py --only lint,lint-docs   # just these; --skip NAME,... leaves some out
     python3 scripts/check.py --ci      # lint.yml: log groups, annotations, a step summary
