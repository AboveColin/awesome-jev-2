"""What a row's `observed_thresholds` records, and the rules lint.py keeps on it.

"What threshold should I use?" is the question people building on Jev ask
most, and the catalogue used to answer it with a number copied out of one row's
notes by hand. `observed_thresholds` records instead, per row, the constants
the one file `evidence.path` cites compares a Jev answer with, as that file
writes them (schema/entry.schema.json):

* `question_type`: the primitive whose answer is compared;
* `compares`: which quantity of that answer: a `noul`'s `probability`, a
  `choice`'s or `score`'s `confidence`, one option's `probability`, or a
  `score`'s value (`score`). It names Jev's answer, whatever the project's
  variable is called;
* `value`: the constant;
* `decision`: what the code does, and on which side of the constant;
* `source`: the text in the file that holds the constant. It must be one of
  `evidence.matched`, so the weekly `claims` run re-reads it like every other
  matched string: a project that moves its threshold turns the claim red, and
  a person re-reads the file;
* `read_on`: the day a person read it. Without it a model read the file and no
  person has since; docs/review-queue.md lists those rows.

An observation, never a recommendation: a threshold is one project's policy for
what being wrong costs it, tuned (if at all) on its own data and model version.
A `noul` probability is not a `choice` confidence, and nothing here moves from
one to the other. `_stats` counts the rows and the lowest and highest constant
per question type and quantity; SKILL.md and examples/README.md state those as
build_docs inline values, never as typed numbers (lint_docs rejects a decimal
range typed outside a marker).

What lint holds (lint.check_thresholds):
* the field needs `evidence`: every source is a string in the cited file;
* not on a `not-jev` row: its answers are another model's, whose calibration
  says nothing about Jev's;
* not on a row citing this repository's own files: examples/ here show this
  repository's starting points, not an observation of anyone's policy;
* each `source` is one of `evidence.matched`, and `value` is written in it;
* the answer the question type returns carries the compared quantity (a `noul`
  answer is a probability alone: ANSWERS);
* a probability or a confidence is at most 1;
* each `read_on` is a real date, not in the future.

Stdlib only, like the rest of scripts/.
