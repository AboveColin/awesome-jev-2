"""Refill every generated number and table inside the hand-written docs.

The README was always generated. The docs around it were not, and every one of
them froze at the first build: status.md said 148 entries and listed
`retry-control` as a pattern nobody had published, sources.md warned that
fourteen linked projects had no licence when the real number was 171, and the
site's link-preview text still said 148. None of that was ever wrong on the day
it was written. It became wrong silently, which is worse.

The site's link-preview tags are no longer here: since 2026-09-27 they are
written at deploy by `assemble_site.py --deploy`, and git keeps a placeholder.

The rule this enforces: a number describing the catalogue may appear only where
something re-derives it. Here that means one of

  * a block — `<!-- name:start -->` … `<!-- name:end -->` — whose whole body is
    generated (a table or a list), or
  * an inline value — `<!--n:key-->805<!--/n-->` — inside a hand-written sentence.

Both are invisible once rendered. The prose around them stays hand-written.
lint.py rejects a bare catalogue count anywhere else, so a new stale number
cannot creep back in. Dated history (docs/method.md) is exempt by design: a log
entry saying the first build had 148 entries is true forever.

Run: python3 scripts/build_docs.py
     python3 scripts/build_docs.py --check    # CI: fail if anything is stale
