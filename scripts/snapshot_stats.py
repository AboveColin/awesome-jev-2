"""Keep a dated snapshot of the catalogue's counts in history/, one per weekly refresh.

catalog.json holds each row as it is now: a star count, a licence, flags. The
figures the READMEs and docs/status.md publish are recomputed from it and
overwritten on every change, so nothing in the repository said what they were
last month, and the week's digest went with the runner. This writes
history/<date>.json, named by the UTC date it runs, holding

  * `stats`: _stats.compute() as it stands, every published number;
  * `counts`: rows per kind, pattern, flag, language and declared licence
    (_stats.shape(), the breakdowns docs/shape.md and counts.py print);
  * `rows`: each row's slug, stars, repo_license and flags, the facts the
    weekly refresh moves, so a later reader can say which rows changed;

under a header that says it is generated. Only metadata.yml runs it, after the
refresh and before its commit, so every snapshot is the state that refresh
committed. It is derived data, never a source: nothing reads a snapshot back
into catalog.json. docs/shape.md reads the files for its table of how the
counts moved (build_shape.py), and says how many there are until there are
enough to be a trend.

No backfill: git's history of catalog.json before the first snapshot spans a
few days of bulk edits, and re-running today's definitions over those commits
would put numbers in history/ that nobody published. A date before the newest
snapshot is refused for the same reason; running twice on one day rewrites
that day's file, identically if nothing moved.

Stdlib only, like the rest of scripts/.

Run: python3 scripts/snapshot_stats.py                  # history/<today, UTC>.json
     python3 scripts/snapshot_stats.py --date 2026-10-07
