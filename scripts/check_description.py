"""Check that the published repository description still matches the catalogue.

The description is the single most-read sentence this project publishes — it is
what appears in GitHub search, in the social card and in every link preview —
and it was the one claim in the whole repository that nothing could check. It
lives in GitHub's database, not in git, so it sat at "148 verified examples"
while the catalogue grew to 805 and no build ever went red.

That is precisely the failure mode the catalogue exists to argue against, so it
gets the same treatment as everything else: a number that is asserted in public
has to be re-derivable from the data.

Since 2026-09-27 the sentence is `_stats.pitch_public()`, which states the
count floored to the hundred, so it goes stale only when the catalogue crosses
a hundred or the wording changes, not with every merged row. And drift is
reported rather than failed: fixing it needs admin rights on the repository,
which no workflow token holds, and a check that turns `main` red over something
CI cannot fix teaches everyone to ignore red. `.github/workflows/description.yml`
runs this with `--report` on every push to `main` and keeps one open issue,
labelled `description`, carrying the exact command.

Read-only. A missing token or an unreachable API is reported as `skipped`, not
as drift: a network hiccup must not open an issue nobody can act on.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/check_description.py              # a person: exit 1 on drift
  python3 scripts/check_description.py --report F   # CI: on drift write the issue
                                                    # body to F, warn, exit 0
