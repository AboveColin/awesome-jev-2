"""Generate README.md and README.zh-CN.md from catalog.json.

catalog.json is the only place a fact is edited. Both READMEs are build
artifacts: CI rejects a hand edit to either, and lint's regenerate job rewrites
both on main after every change, so there is no way to hand-patch one language
and leave the other stale.

Layout logic lives in render() exactly once. The two languages differ only by
the string pack passed in, which is what keeps them structurally identical
instead of slowly diverging.

The code lives in the scripts/readme/ package: strings.py (both string packs),
rows.py (paths, labels, one row), sections.py (render(), one function per
README section) and pages.py (docs/by-pattern/ and docs/measured.md). This
file is the command and the names other scripts and tests import from it.
Patch a name where it is read (readme.sections.START_HERE,
readme.sections.ROOT), not here: nothing reads this module's copies, so a patch
here changes nothing.

Readability rules the package enforces, learned the hard way:

* Long `notes` prose only appears in the curated sections, where there are few
  rows and the note *is* the point. In the big pattern tables it would make
  every row several lines tall and destroy scanning, so those carry short flag
  pills instead and the full note lives in catalog.json and on the site.
* Native links do the navigation. An SVG embedded as an image cannot make its
  labels clickable, so the coverage figure is paired with a real pattern index.
* Anything that is really a table is rendered as a table, not as prose or as a
  comma-separated wall of links.
