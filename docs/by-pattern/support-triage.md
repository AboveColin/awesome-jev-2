# Support triage

<sub>[awesome-jev](../../README.md) · [中文](support-triage.zh-CN.md)</sub>

_Route support tickets and conversations by intent and urgency._

Every catalogued example of this decision — 8 of them. The same rows, with caveats, are in [the index](../../README.md#support-triage); [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?p=support-triage&lang=en) can filter them further by language, primitive and kind.

★ gives a repository's GitHub stars as a band — ★10+, ★100+, ★1k+, ★10k+ and ★100k+; rows with no repository or under 10 stars show no band. Rows run official first, then with code, then by band, then by title. A band is a popularity signal, not a quality verdict; the exact count, as last read from GitHub, is in [`catalog.json`](../../catalog.json) and on [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?lang=en).

- **[Quickstart](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction/quickstart)** ⭐ — The canonical first call: one support ticket, one Choice, one Score and one Noul in a single request, in Python, JS and cURL.

- **[ai-cookbook: Jev track](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/ai-cookbook)** — A graded course from a first call through each primitive, state shapes and criteria, to ticket triage and a multi-step workflow, mirroring all four official patterns.

- **[spring-ai-typesafe](https://spring.io/blog/2026/09/21/spring-ai-typesafe-structured-judgment)** — A community Spring AI starter bringing typed decisions to Java, with a builder API over the three question types.

- **[Example: three primitives in one request](https://github.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev/blob/main/examples/01-three-primitives/main.py)** — A minimal first call asking a choice, a score and a noul together, annotated with the asymmetries that catch people out.

- **[Jev AI Use Cases](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/jev-ai-use-cases-9a87d57ac3b4)** — Walks through use case after use case — agent routing, an in-agent decision layer, ticket triage — each with a concrete option set and a sample response.

- **[Jev on AI/ML API](https://docs.aimlapi.com/api-references/decision-models/typesafe/jev)** — Another gateway route, notable because its endpoint path and request envelope differ again from both the native API and Cloudflare's.

- **[Jev on Cloudflare Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai/models/typesafe/jev/)** — Workers AI binding and REST samples asking a noul, a choice and a score in one call, with the full response including per-answer confidence.

- **[jev-triage](https://github.com/boldbug1/jev-triage)** — Message triage CLI in Go, built on the Jev decision model from TypeSafe AI. Categorizes messages, scores urgency, and flags low-confidence ones for human review.
