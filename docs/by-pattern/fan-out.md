# Speculative fan-out

<sub>[awesome-jev](../../README.md) · [中文](fan-out.zh-CN.md)</sub>

_Pack many questions — including speculative ones — into one request and let code pick what mattered._

Every catalogued example of this decision — 32 of them. The same rows, with caveats, are in [the index](../../README.md#speculative-fan-out); [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?p=fan-out&lang=en) can filter them further by language, primitive and kind.

★ gives a repository's GitHub stars as a band — ★10+, ★100+, ★1k+, ★10k+ and ★100k+; rows with no repository or under 10 stars show no band. Rows run official first, then with code, then by band, then by title. A band is a popularity signal, not a quality verdict; the exact count, as last read from GitHub, is in [`catalog.json`](../../catalog.json) and on [the site](https://kydlikebtc.github.io/awesome-jev/?lang=en).
