"""The wire_pattern prompt: what an agent about to wire one decision needs,
in one message.

A coding agent asked to "add a Jev tool-selection gate in TypeScript on
Cloudflare" would otherwise make four calls and still lack two things the
catalogue has: the pattern's own "when not to use it", and a skeleton to start
from. This assembles, from the data it is handed:

* the pattern's description from patterns.json, and a link to its section of
  docs/patterns.md, where "when NOT to use this" is written by hand (that prose
  stays there, the one place it is reviewed);
* compat.json's fields for the surface asked about — model strings, envelope,
  answer field, key variable — or the surfaces to choose from;
* up to five rows filed under the pattern that cite the file their code was
  read in, each linked at HEAD as the site links it (evidence_url.py) and
  dated only by a person's reading, with its caveats and what they mean;
* the skeleton from this repository's examples/ for that pattern and language,
  when there is one (examples/index.json), under a comment saying it was never
  executed, or a plain statement that there is none.

server.py registers it and says where the catalogue and the examples index
came from. Standard library only, like query.py; tested without `mcp` in
tests/test_mcp_prompt.py.
