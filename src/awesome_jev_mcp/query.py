"""What the MCP server's tools and resources answer, as plain functions over
the data they are handed.

server.py registers the tools and resources and stamps every result with where
the data came from; everything they decide is here — which rows count as
examples, which caveats travel with a row and what each one means, the order
results come in, whether a model string is real. Standard library only and no
module state: each function takes the catalogue, the taxonomy, the curated
collections or compat.json as an argument. That is what lets the
repository's CI, which installs nothing, test the answers on a handful of rows
(tests/test_mcp_query.py, tests/test_mcp_resources.py) without `mcp` and
