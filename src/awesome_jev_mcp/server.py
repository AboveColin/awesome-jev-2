"""An MCP server over the awesome-jev catalogue.

A catalogue about how agents make decisions that only humans can read is a
strange artefact. This exposes it to the agents themselves: an assistant about
to wire Jev into something can ask for examples of the exact decision it is
making, on the platform it is using, in the language it is writing.

Three design choices worth knowing:

* **Caveats are never optional.** Every result carries its flags. The point of
  this catalogue is that `not-jev`, `shadow-mode-only` and `vendor-reported`
  travel with the row; an agent that got a recommendation without them would be
  worse informed than one that read the README. Rows keep the bare keys, and
  every answer holding flagged rows ends with `caveat_glossary`: what each flag
  among them means, from taxonomy.json (the whole list is the
  `awesome-jev://flags` resource).
* **Results are trimmed by default.** An agent pays for every token of a tool
  result, so `search_examples` returns compact rows and `get_example` returns
  the whole thing when one row actually matters.
* **The data's own provenance is a caveat too.** Installed as a package there is
  no repository around this file, so the catalogue is fetched and cached. Every
  result therefore carries a `data` line naming which layer answered and how
  current it is, and anything stale says so in capitals. See `data.py` for the
  ladder; the short version is that a checkout beats the network, the network
  beats the cache, and the snapshot in the wheel is the last resort rather than
  the default.

Beside the tools, four resources hand an agent what it would otherwise piece
together from several calls: `awesome-jev://flags` (what each caveat means),
`awesome-jev://collections` and `awesome-jev://collections/{id}` (the curated
editorial entry points, each pick with a reason and a caution), and
`awesome-jev://patterns/{key}` (every row filed under one decision pattern, as
the site's api/v1 file for it holds them). One prompt, `wire_pattern`, puts
what a coding agent needs to wire one decision into a single message: the
pattern and its section of docs/patterns.md, one surface's compat.json fields,
cited rows and the repository's own skeleton for it (`prompts.py`).

Unlike the rest of this repository, this file has a dependency. Hand-rolling
stdio JSON-RPC would keep the zero-dependency streak, but a subtly broken MCP
server is worse than a dependency. The dependency stops at this file: it
registers the tools and resources and stamps where the data came from, and what
each one answers is `query.py`, standard library only like `data.py`. The
catalogue's own CI tests those two directly and imports this module only in
tests that stub `mcp` out — the dependency-free build pipeline is untouched.

Run:
    pip install awesome-jev-mcp
    awesome-jev-mcp

If pip finds no such package, install the same server from the repository:
    pip install git+https://github.com/kydlikebtc/awesome-jev

From a checkout, `python3 -m awesome_jev_mcp` does the same thing and serves the
working tree rather than the published catalogue.

            apart from another route. An unknown one lists the valid ones.
        comparator: rows whose benchmark measurement compared Jev with
            something named like this, e.g. "Cohere", "Haiku",
            "cross-encoder" (a fragment, ignoring case). A row's

    """Return one catalogue row in full, including its sources and evidence.

    `evidence` names the file the row's code was read in; a scheduled job
    re-reads it weekly, so the claim is checkable rather than asserted.
    `evidence.kind` says what that file shows: `call-site` (the default when
    absent) is where the project calls Jev; `wire-shape` is a file that speaks
    Jev's request shape rather than building on Jev (every `alternative` row,
    whether it serves that shape or sends Jev the same request to compare, and
    adapters backed by other models); and `example-only` is an example the
    project ships, not its own integration.

    `summary_source` says whose words `summary` is: `upstream-description` is
    the project's own GitHub description, word for word when the weekly
    refresh last compared them; `upstream-description-stale` was taken from it
    and no longer matches; `curated` was written for this catalogue. Absent
    means it is not recorded. search_examples() carries it too.

    `sources` says where the row came from. After the sources a person wrote,
    each item shaped `{"catalog": "owner/name", "url":
    "https://github.com/owner/name"}` is a sibling-list citation: that other
    Jev directory's README linked the row's repository when the weekly refresh
    last read it. The directories copy from each other, so how many cite a row
    says how widely it is mentioned, not that anyone checked it.

    `patterns_reviewed` is the date a person read the row against the decision
    patterns; search_examples() carries it too. Absent means no such reading
    is recorded: many rows' patterns are what keyword rules suggested from the
    project's description, and `overview` is what those rules give when nothing
    matches, so a project or plugin with code filed only under `overview` and
    no `patterns_reviewed` is not yet indexed by pattern rather than a survey.

    `repo_created_at`, `repo_pushed_at` and `repo_commits` are GitHub's own
    facts about the linked repository as the weekly refresh last read them:
    when it was created and last pushed to (UTC) and how many commits its
    default branch has; search_examples() carries them too. They are not a
    judgement: an old push does not mean abandoned, and nothing here says
    whether a project is maintained. Wherever `repo_commits` is recorded, the
    `single-commit` caveat is set exactly when it is 1. Absent on rows without
    a GitHub repository.

    `question_types` lists the primitives a person read the code calling.
    `primitives_seen` is something else: a weekly script's text signal that the
    one file `evidence` cites contains those primitives' request or answer
    shape (`"type": "choice"`, `Noul(`, `.noul`). A shape in a file is not a
    call, nobody read it, and search_examples(question_type=...) never matches
    on it.

    `measurement`, on a benchmark row, indexes what the row's own author
    reported: the task, named datasets, comparators, kinds of metric, n, the
    model string, when (`as_of`), whether per-item data is published
    (`raw_data`) or the protocol was fixed first (`preregistered`), and
    `direction`, the author's conclusion: author-stated, not reproduced here,
    as its `direction_note` says. `read_on` dates a person's reading of the
    report against these fields; without it a script or a model filled them
    in. search_examples() carries it too.

    `negative_result: true` marks a row whose own author measured Jev for its
    use and concluded against it: a benchmark whose `measurement.direction`
    is unfavourable, or a row of another kind flagged `negative-result`.
    Author-stated, not reproduced here. search_examples() carries it too.

    `wire`, on some `alternative` rows, records what the project's own files
    show about the interface it offers in place of Jev: its `endpoint`, how it
    spells the yes/no type (`yesno_spelling`) and where the answer and the
    confidence are read (`answer_field`, `confidence_field`), the request
    `envelope`, where its answers come from (`weights`: open, closed, or a
    proxy in front of another provider's model; `base_model`), whether it
    sends Jev the same requests to compare (`calls_real_jev_as_baseline`), a
    `comparison_url`, and the files it was read in (`source`, re-read weekly;
    `read_on` dates a person's reading). A field the files do not show is
    absent. A compatible interface implies nothing about calibration: those
    rows are flagged `not-jev`. search_examples() leaves it out.

    `observed_thresholds` lists constants the one file `evidence` cites
    compares a Jev answer with: the primitive (`question_type`), which of its
    answer's quantities (`compares`: a noul's `probability`, a choice's or a
    score's `confidence`, one option's `probability`, a score's value), the
    constant (`value`), what the code does on which side of it (`decision`),
    and the text it stands on (`source`, one of `evidence.matched`, re-read
    weekly). What that project chose for what being wrong costs it, not a
    recommendation: a threshold tuned on a noul probability says nothing about
    a choice confidence, and none transfers across model versions. `read_on`
    dates a person's reading; without it a model read the file.
    search_examples() leaves it out.

    `caveat_glossary`, after the row's own fields, says in English what each
    of its `flags` means (awesome-jev://flags lists them all).
